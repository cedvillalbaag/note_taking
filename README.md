# How to take notes to accelerate learning.

### Objectives:

- Use note-taking to accelerate learning.
- Create an efficient way to access information in the future (framework of reference).
- Minimum effort, maximum possible results.

### Materials:

- Notebook
- Blue/Black Ink Pen
- Highlighter pen, to emphasize certain words.

### Pre-Note Taking

- Priming: A learning technique that exposes you to the material before learning it, helping you retain information better.
- Priming is a technique that uses prior stimuli to facilitate learning or retrieving information later. Basically, it involves preparing the mind for a specific learning process or preparing the memory for a recall process, making the processing of related information faster and more efficient.

### Note Taking

- It's important to create a note-taking system because it allows us to reference it in the future so we don't waste a lot of time analyzing how to develop them.
- Note-taking should focus on three elements: high-level concepts, making your own ideas or connections, and finally, developing complete examples.

**Note Taking - Focus on high-level concepts**

- Write down the concepts, headings, and key phrases.

**Note Taking - Focus on your own insight and connections**

- Make your own connections and conclusions to help you understand the knowledge and not forget it easily.
- This encourages you to actively think about the information and include it in your knowledge list.

**Develop Full Examples**

- It allows all the information being learned to come together in a concrete way:
- Understand how the information interacts with each other.
- Allows you to tackle more complex questions from beginning to end.
- It will help you quickly understand concepts, rather than piecing together all the pieces of information.


### Post Note Taking:

- Leave a little extra space.
- Recount everything you covered in your study notes in your own words, without looking at the notes.
- Jot down some additional summary points.

Rather than simply reading or rereading notes, Active Recall involves actively working to recall information without referencing it, generating questions and searching for answers from memory.
